## Formula 1 Data Analysis (1950â€“2024)
This project explores the evolution, performance trends, and race dynamics in the **Formula 1 World Championship** using historical data from 1950 through 2024. The analysis uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle and dives into a variety of exploratory, performance-based, geographic, and lap-level questions. 

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data)
- **Data Includes**: Drivers, races, circuits, constructors, lap times, pit stops, qualifying results, status (e.g., crashes), and more.

## Project Aim

The goal is to explore various aspects of F1 history and performance using real-world data. By answering targeted questions, the project highlights trends in driver performance, circuit characteristics, and changes in the sport over time.

## Project Structure

## Tools
- **Languages**: Python and SQL
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, dplyr, matplotlib.pyplot, statistics
- **Environments**: Pycharm, DB Browser for SQLite

## Key Questions Explored

1. How has the number of races per season evolved over time? See results here: [Evolution of F1 Race Counts per Season](images/race_counts_year_graph.png)
3. Which drivers raced for the most teams during their careers? 
4. Which circuits have the best and the worst pole-to-win conversion rate?
